# Silencer Minecraft mod (Forge)

A Forge mod that provides an item that allows you to silence entities:

![You can silence villagers for example](assets/use.png)

The silencer is craftable:

![Shaped recipe. In order from left to right, top to bottom: Honey Block, Clay ball, Empty, Clay ball, Red Dye, Empty, Empty, Empty, Clay Ball](assets/recipe-silencer.png)

You can also craft an un-silencer which can be used to restore entities. It is also craftable:

![Shaped recipe. In order from left to right, top to bottom: Clay ball, Clay ball, Clay ball, Clay ball, Redstone Torch, Clay ball, Empty, Empty, Clay Ball](assets/recipe-unsilencer.png)

Both items are stackable. When used by the player on an entity, the entity will be silenced/unsilenced, and the item will be consumed.

If the entity had been silenced/unsilenced before then nothing will happen, and the item will remain in the player's hand.
