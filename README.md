# Silencer Minecraft mod (Forge)

A Forge mod that provides an item that allows you to silence entities:

![You can silence villagers for example](assets/use.png)

The silencer is craftable:

![Shaped recipe. In order from left to right, top to bottom: Honey Block, Clay ball, Empty, Clay ball, Red Dye, Empty, Empty, Empty, Clay Ball](assets/recipe.png)

This is a stackable item. When used by the player on an entity, the entity will be silenced, and the item will be consumed.

If the entity had been silenced before then nothing will happen, and the item will remain in the player's hand.
